# Pandas

**Pandas** is a package for data manipulation and analysis in Python. The name Pandas is derived from the econometrics term Panel Data. Pandas incorporates two additional data structures into Python, namely **Pandas Series** and **Pandas DataFrame**. These data structures allow us to work with labeled and relational data in an easy and intuitive manner.
